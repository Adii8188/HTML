        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent
        revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics
        set about creating new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the 
        initial concept for Iron Man.

        Iron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel 
        characters.[122] Lee wrote the character to represent liberal 
        capitalism, fighting against communism and other anti-democratic 
        forces.[123][124][125] Though anti-communist sentiments were present 
        throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories.
